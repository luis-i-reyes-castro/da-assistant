# Instructions

* This is a software development/debug run.
* We are working on being able to upload messages with images to your API.
* In each turn:
    * The user will attempt to give you an image input.
    * If you receive the image then:
        * Respond with a **short description** of what you see in the image **(1 sentence)**.
        * Use function/tool "dummy_tool" to further confirm reception.
    * Otherwise inform the user that you did not receive the image.
